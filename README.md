# McHacks12
Collaborative project by: Clara Goussanou, Luna Kang, and Nimrat Singh.

This project was inspired from fellow students in the medical field who would quiz each other on medical conditions in an engaging and interactive fashion. It generates symptoms, from broader to more specific, until the student can correctly guess the medical condition. The symptoms appear one at a time in specific intervals. The maximum time a student can take to diagnose is 60s. There is a sidebar indicating all possible diagnoses and there is a section that collects all past guesses (red if they were wrong and green if it was right) as well as a section that collects the student's best time and worst time. We built the site using HTML and CSS.  One of our challenges was to figure out how to collect the data. We tried Gumloop and ParseHub but we finally decided to use a reputable medical website as our source and store the data ourselves.
